## Education
**University of Toronto, Hon. BSc.** _September 2013 - June 2017_

Ecology and Evolutionary Biology, Specialist

**University of Toronto, PhD,** _starting September 2017_

Evolutionary epidemiology, theoretical biology

## Research
### Weis Lab, University of Toronto, _August 2015 - August 2017_

**Research courses:** EEB395 (2015-2016), EEB498 (2016-2017);
**Funded projects:** NSERC-USRA (2016), UTEA (2017)

My work in the Weis Lab has focused on theoretical population genetics. Using a combination of mathematical and computational approaches, my projects investigate the maintenance of genetic variation in pollen competitive ability in mixed-mating systems as well as the interplay of _isolation-by-distance_ and _isolation-by-time_ in flowering plant populations. My work has been done primarily in R, with some reliance on Visual Basic and Mathematica.
