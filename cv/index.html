  My work in the Weis Lab has focused on theoretical population genetics. Using a combination of mathematical and computational approaches, my projects investigate the maintenance of genetic variation in pollen competitive ability in mixed-mating systems as well as the interplay of <i> isolation-by-distance </i> and <i> isolation-by-time </i> in flowering plant populations. My work has been done primarily in R, with some reliance on Visual Basic and Mathematica.
